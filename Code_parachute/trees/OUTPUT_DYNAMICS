 -------- DYNAMICS ROUTINE --------

Initial conditions:
	 z0 = 100.000 [km] (initial altitude)	 vx0 = 200.000 [m/s] (initial horizontal velocity)	 vz0 = 0.000 [m/s] (initial vertical velocity)	 vz_final = 20.000 [m/s] (desired final descent rate)

 Here are the relevant quantities for each possible altitude of drogue deployment. Use these to select an altitude for the deployment of the drogue. For deployment of main, z = 500 m should be a reasonable initial guess.

	 Maximum deceleration: 24.313 g
	Mach number at drogue deployment: 3.715
 	 Opening load (drogue): 12717.454 [N]
	>>>> WARNING: the opening load for the drogue parachute could be excessive. Consider changing some input value!
	 Opening load (main): 37426.114 [N]
	>>>> WARNING: the opening load for the main parachute could be excessive. Consider changing some input value!
	 Constructed surface of drogue parachute = 0.210 [m^2]
	 Constructed surface of main parachute = 6.407 [m^2]
	 Total time for reeentry: 181.08 [s]
