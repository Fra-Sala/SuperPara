 -------- SUPERSONIC DESIGN PRELIMINARY PARACHUTE -------


 1. DROGUE DESIGN
You selected a hemisflo parachute.
The selected drogue parachute will be deployed in supersonic conditions, at Mach = 3.06
Here are the design parameters for the drogue:

	S0 = 0.207 [m^2]
	D0 = 0.514 [m]
	Dp = 0.336 [m]
	Drag coeff. related to S0, cd0 = 0.35 [-]
	Î”t inflation = 0.00537 [s]
	Altitude of deployment = 6000.00[m]
	Total porosity = 31.193 %
	Inflation load = 16863.140 [N]
	cx factor = 1.250 
	X1 factor = 0.950 
	Length of suspension lines  = 1.03 [m]
	Number of gores 
	Gore height h_s  = 0.235 [m]
	D_v (vent diameter) = 
	Canopy cone angle
